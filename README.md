Python implmenetation of Probability of Backtest Overfitting. [1]

Features:

* Probability of backtest overfitting
* Probability of Out of Sample (OOS) Below Threshold
* Performance Degradation
* Stochastic Dominance

TODO:

Add other features as as:
* PSR statistics [2]
* Minimum backtest length (MinBTL)
* Minimum track record length (MinTRL)
